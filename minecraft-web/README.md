# Minecraft Web Prototype

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed local URL to see the world. Use `WASD` to fly, the mouse to look (click the canvas to lock the pointer), and the space/shift keys to move vertically. A spinning cube confirms rendering is working.

## Building

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The build command emits a production bundle and type-checks the project.
